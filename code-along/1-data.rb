# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb
# puts "Hello, world"

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
# puts 7.77
# Perform simple math with numbers
# puts 5 + 2

# Strings
# puts "tacos"
# puts "3 tacos"
# puts 3 + "tacos" <-- this will fail. look below for how to combine strings.

# Combine strings together - text and number for example
# puts "#{3+2} tacos"

# Variables - places in memory where we're storing away these values
# quantity = 3+3+3
# food = "tacos"

# Combine strings and variables
# puts "#{quantity} + food"

# String manipulation
# puts "Hello".upcase - all caps
# puts "Hello".reverse - reverse the text
# puts "Hello".swapcase - swap the cases
